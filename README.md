## About
A simple unsplash searching page using unsplash API.
Try it out here [Link to page](http://unsplash-pepperjs.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Strategy
* The page uses History API to manage the state of the app so 
every search will have it's own history saved on history.
* Saves every search term to `localStorage` and renders a list of 
previously searched terms as suggestions when searching.
